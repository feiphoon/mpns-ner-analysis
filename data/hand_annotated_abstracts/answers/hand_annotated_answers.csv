Centella asiatica has many applications in cosmetics, including wrinkle treatments, but its effectiveness remains to be clarified. This systematic review study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of C. asiatica for reducing facial wrinkles. PubMed, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Thai Library Integrated System, and Thai university database/journals were searched until May 2019. Five double-blinded randomised controlled trials, including 172 Asian females, were included. Endpoints were wrinkling measured by visual score, image analysis, and participant satisfaction. Two placebo-controlled studies applied gel/creams containing C. asiatica or asiaticoside for 12 w to periorbital skin. Two studies applied tretinoin or Pueraria mirifica contralaterally and by network meta-analysis C. asiatica appeared more effective than P. mirifica but possibly less than tretinoin. Asiaticoside applied as a lipstick for 8 w reduced lip wrinkling. Skin hydration was markedly raised by C. asiatica but not tretinoin. One study reported 10 adverse events for C. asiatica and 35 for tretinoin. Cochrane risk of bias was generally low, reporting was weak, and lack of C. asiatica standardization prevents general application. From the reported data, it is possible to conclude that C. asiatica improved lip and periocular wrinkles, and may replace retinoids if its long-term safety is established and C. asiatica is standardized.",Centella Asiatica (L.)

(C. asiatica) has been widely treated for inflammation-related diseases in China for thousands of years. While C. asiatica showed relevant effects as traditional medicine, the mechanism of C. asiatica suppressing inflammation has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to reveal the anti-inflammatory mechanism of methanol fraction from C. asiatica (MCA) at the molecular level in murine macrophages. Levels of inflammation-related mediators were observed with treatment of MCA. MCA significantly suppressed nitric oxide production and iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Prostaglandin E2 production was alleviated by MCA via the downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2. MCA treatment also reduced pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-[Formula: see text] and interleukin (IL)-6 levels. LPS/D-GalN-induced acute hepatitis in mouse was alleviated by MCA treatment. In addition, MCA decreased the phosphorylation of inhibitory [Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] (I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text]) at Ser32/36 and thereby blocked I[Formula: see text]B[Formula: see text] degradation.

26,32948004,"Optimization of Light Intensity, Temperature, and Nutrients to Enhance the Bioactive Content of Hyperforin and Rutin in St. John's Wort. St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a medicinal plant that alleviates depression and other disorders due to its abundance of active ingredients. Hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin are the main active, and important, ingredients in St. John's wort that alleviate depression. In order to investigate the optimal conditions for accumulating these active ingredients, design of experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) was employed in this study. Two-month-old St John's wort plants were cultivated in growth chambers at varying temperatures, light intensities, and nutrient solution concentrations before analysis by HPLC, for determining differences in hyperforin, rutin, and melatonin content. The results showed that hyperforin and rutin contents were significantly influenced by temperature (18-23 °C) and light intensity (49-147 μmol m-2 s-1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)), whereas Hoagland's nutrient solution concentration (25-75%) had little effect. The accumulation of melatonin might not be influenced by cultivation conditions. Light intensity and temperature are easily controlled environmental factors in artificial cultivation, both of which are related to secondary metabolite production in the plant. Based on RSM, the optimal conditions for the accumulation of hyperforin and rutin were obtained.

However, whether it can substitute for neurotrophic factors to induce human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSCs) differentiation into the neural lineage remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a raw extract of C. asiatica (L.) (RECA) on the neural differentiation of hMSCs in vitro.",Indian Pennywort,common,151,167
36,30043286,"Trace Element Uptake and Accumulation in the Medicinal Herb Hypericum perforatum L. Across Different Geolithological Settings. The worldwide growing interest in traditional medicines, including herbal medicines and herbal dietary supplements, has recently been accompanied by concerns on quality and safety of this type of health care. The content of nutritional and potentially toxic elements in medicinal plants is of paramount interest as it may vary remarkably according to different environmental and ecophysiological factors. In this study, the concentrations of essential and non-essential trace elements-Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Sr, and Zn-were determined in the roots and aerial parts of the worldwide distributed and economically important medicinal herb Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort) and in its growing substrate. Most of the analyzed trace elements varied considerably in the plant parts according to edaphic conditions and soil geochemistry. However, uptake and retention in H. perforatum compartments of Co, Cr, and Ni, which markedly differentiated the investigated soils, were controlled by excluding mechanisms of the plant. Despite this, the Ni concentrations in the aerial parts, commonly used in herbal preparations, of H. perforatum plants from serpentine soils were not insignificant in relation to eventual human consumption. Good practice to assure the herbal product quality of H. perforatum collected from the wild cannot ignore the thorough understanding of the geolithological and geochemical features of the harvesting areas.",Hypericum perforatum L,scientific,60,82

37,33383372,"Improvements in estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia by Hypericum perforatum L. extract are associated with gut microbiota and related metabolites in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Hypericum perforatum L. (HP), a well-known natural medicine, has a potential effect on menopausal hypercholesterolemia. However, the effect of HP extract on gut microbiota and related metabolites, which play vital roles in metabolic disease occurrence, in the context of estrogen deficiency have not yet been reported. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effects of HP extract on gut microbial composition and related metabolite profiles in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and reveal the relationships between pathological indicators and alterations in both gut microbial composition at the genus level and metabolites. Body weight, serum parameters, liver lipids and histomorphology were determined. Microbial composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. Fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and serum bile acids were quantitatively measured. Correlations between pathological indicators and alteration in gut microbiota and metabolites were investigated using Spearman's rank correlation test. Gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) in the liver and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; GPR43 and GPR41), ZO-1 and occludin in the cecum were determined by PCR. Microbial composition and metabolite profiles were significantly changed in OVX rats compared with sham rats. Twelve bacterial genera, 5 SCFAs and 12 bile acids were identified as differential biomarkers. Differential genera, SCFAs and bile acids were closely associated with weight, total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In OVX rats, HP administration can significantly reverse the pathological symptoms of body weight gain, serum lipid disorders and hepatic steatosis, at the meanwhile, reestablish gut microbial composition and metabolite profiles. Moreover, HP administration significantly upregulated the levels of CYP7A1, GPR43 and GPR41. In conclusion, HP can ameliorate estrogen deficiency-induced hypercholesterolemia. The underlying mechanism may be associated with improvements in gut microbiota composition and the profile of related metabolites as well as increases in bile acid secretion.",Hypericum perforatum L.,scientific,68,91
